# Git Hooks

This project has two githooks included that help ensure code quality seamlessly without requiring
manual intervention from the developer. The git hooks can be found in [this folder](../git-hooks)

There is a pre-commit hook which automatically formats our kotlin code, and a pre-push hook to make 
sure all of our static analysis checks pass.
