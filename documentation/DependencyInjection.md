## Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is important to ensure that portions of our code can be easily tested and 
dependencies can be seamlessly without heavily impacting our application code.

This project uses the [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) 
DI library because it is Google's official recommendation for dependency injection.
